# Hash Table
In Javascript hastable is object. basket.grapes = 100; in array we find a value by index ike index7 has a value of 100num. but in sa hash we find the value by key(grapes) that has the value 100; a hash function decides where to put/store the value and key;
grapes gets passed to a hash function and the function coverst it to a random hash like '565jvb3r4v223recer3u' and this random hash gets convert as a memrylocation/address where it stores the value 100;
