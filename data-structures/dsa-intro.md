### What is good code?

1. Readability
2. Scalability (time and space complexity/ memeory and speed)

In JavaScript there are 8 supported data types:  
• Undefined - a value of a variable that has not been assigned a value  
• Null - a value representing the intentional absence of any value  
• Boolean - a logical entity having two values, true and false  
• Number - a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format  
• BigInt - a numeric data type to store integer values that are larger than the range supported by the Number data type  
• Symbol - a unique identifier for an object  
• String - a sequence of characters used to represent text  
• Object - a data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data
