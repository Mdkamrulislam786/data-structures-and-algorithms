# Dynamic Programing

It is an optimization technique. It is a technique of braking the problems into sub problems and caching them for future needs.

Memoization~~~caching
It is a solution to store calcukation so we dont have to calculate the same calculation again.

Dynamic Programing = divide & conqure + memoization  

Use memoization when the problem :  

1. can be divide into sub problems
2. recursive solutions
3. are there repetitive subproblems
4. memoization subproblems

Here are some popular Dynamic Programming Questions (see if you can notice the pattern):

1. House Robber
2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
3. Climbing Stairs
